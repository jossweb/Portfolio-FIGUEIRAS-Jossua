    text: "	I like setting myself challenges, which is why I have decided to participate in the Swift Student Challenge in 2026. It will be a challenge for me on a technical level since I have had very little practice with Swift and its frameworks. The first challenge will be to gain confidence with these technologies. The second challenge will be to come up with a unique concept in order to deliver an outstanding and high-quality project.",
